# supersimple_AC_leaderboard
This is a very simple method of creating a local leaderboard for Assetto Corsa.  
The program was created so that a timetrial event could be held on a single computer.  
The program waits for the Assetto Corsa aplication to close, then opens a window where you can input a first and last name.  
A combination of name, trackname and the best laptime of the session is then saved in a .csv file.  
  
IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  
  
The program is very simple, and horribly written.  
At the time of making this, I(the writer of this program) am a first year student with only 1.5 months of python experience.  
  
The program has been made for a very specific purpose, and might not work for other.  
It was also created with my own hardware in mind, and might not work as intended for others.  
  
NOTE:  
  
The program has only been tested with the Assetto Corsa third party launcher "Content Manager", and might not work without it.  
Some python knowlege is definitely required.  
tkinter and watchdog modules required
